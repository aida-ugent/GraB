This repository contains the source code, installation and use instructions for the method presented in the paper: 

*Mashayekhi, Yoosof, Bo Kang, Jefrey Lijffijt, and Tijl De Bie. "Quantifying and reducing imbalance in networks." In RECSYS IN HR 2021, vol. 2967. CEUR, 2021*.

We provide Python implementations of the complete GraB model. The repository is maintained by Yoosof Mashayekhi (yoosof.mashayekhi(at)ugent.be).

## Installation

Install directly from GitHub with:


$ pip install git+https://github.com/aida-ugent/GraB.git



**Note:** GraB code has been extensively tested and is stable under Python 3.6.9, thus this is the recommendend environment.
